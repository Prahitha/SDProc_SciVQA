(f): Reading comprehension F1 scores for the BiDAF and QANet models. Fine-tuning on a small number of word overlap (a) and negation (b) examples erases the performance gap (Outcome 1). Fine-tuning does not yield significant improvement on spelling errors (c) and length mismatch (d), but does not degrade original performance either (Outcome 2). Fine-tuning on numerical reasoning (e) closes the gap entirely, but also reduces performance on the original dataset (Outcome 3). On Adversarial SQuAD (f), around 60% of the performance gap is closed after fine-tuning, though performance on the original dataset decreases (Outcome 3). On each challenge dataset, we observe similar trends between different models.\n\nQuestion: In which graph are there y ticks with values that are not multiples of five?\n\nRely on the visual content of the graph like labels, axis content to infer the answer. If the graph is too complicated, take approximations from the axis scale. Need not do intense calculations.Based on the reasoning above, match it to one or more of the provided answer options: {'A': None, 'B': None, 'C': None, 'D': '(d)'}.
