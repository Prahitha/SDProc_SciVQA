As a trade-off between reducing costs (i.e., discarding fewer instances) and increasing reliability, we chose 5 annotators and a threshold of 0.95 for this task, which resulted in \u03ba = 0.58 (moderate to substantial agreement).\n\nQuestion: Which line represents MACE Threshold 0.85?\nBased on the reasoning above, match it to one or more of the provided answer options: {'A': None, 'B': None, 'C': None, 'D': 'The line with triangle markers'}. Return only the corresponding letter(s) of the correct answer(s). Do not explain your choice, do not rephrase the answer, and do not repeat the option text. Only output the letter(s) corresponding to the correct choice. If multiple letters are correct, separate them by commas without spaces (for example: B,C). If all options are correct, return A,B,C,D. Do not add anything else.\nRely on the visual content of the graph like labels, axis content to infer the answer. Need not do intense calculations."
