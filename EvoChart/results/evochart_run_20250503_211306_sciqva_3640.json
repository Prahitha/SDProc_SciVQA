(a) We see a modest reduction in variance (and hence cost) relative to human evaluation by using the VecSim automatic metric with the proposed control variates estimator to estimate Overall scores on the CNN/Daily Mail task; the data efficiency (DE) is 1.06. (b) By improving the evaluation prompt to use Edits instead, it is possible to further reduce variance relative to humans (DE is 1.15). (c) Another way to reduce variance relative to humans is to improve the automatic metric evaluation; here using ROUGE-1 instead of VecSim improves the DE from 1.03 to 1.16.\n\nQuestion: In which graph is the cofidence interval for 'Humans + perfect metric' not the shortest?\n\nRely on the visual content of the graph like labels, axis content to infer the answer.
