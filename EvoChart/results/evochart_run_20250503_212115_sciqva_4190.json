If the graph is too complicated, take approximations from the axis scale. Need not do intense calculations.Based on the reasoning above, match it to one or more of the provided answer options: {'A': None, 'B': None, 'C': None, 'D': 'Red'}. Return only the corresponding letter(s) of the correct answer(s). Do not explain your choice, do not rephrase the answer, and do not repeat the option text. Only output the letter(s) corresponding to the correct choice. If multiple letters are correct, separate them by commas without spaces (for example: B,C). If all options are correct, return A,B,C,D. Do not add anything else."
