        "reasoning": "1. Examine the left graph, which shows the relationship between the number of vertices and the size of the graph and KIC-tree. The turquoise line represents the graph size, and the magenta line represents the KIC-tree size.\n2. Observe that as the number of vertices increases, both the graph size and the KIC-tree size increase, but the KIC-tree size increases at a slower rate.\n3. Examine the right graph, which shows the relationship between the number of keywords and the size of the graph and KIC-tree. Again, the turquoise line represents the graph size, and the magenta line represents the KIC-tree size.\n4. Note that as the number of keywords increases, both the graph size and the KIC-tree size increase, but the KIC-tree size increases at a slower rate compared to the graph size.\n5. Compare the two graphs to see how the number of vertices and keywords affect the size of the graph and KIC-tree. Both graphs show that the KIC-tree size increases at a slower rate than the graph size as the number of vertices or keywords increases."

Observe the position of the black line at this x-axis value.\n5. Estimate the y-axis value of the black line at x = 200.\n6.

The y-axis is labeled as \"F0,\" indicating it represents the fundamental frequency in Hz. The x-axis shows time in 10.0 ms intervals.

Examine the labels and annotations in the first plot to see if they relate to a question.\n2. Note the phonetic transcriptions and time markers to understand the context.\n3.

The \"Normal Classifier\" is represented by a blue line, and the \"Embeded Classifier\" is represented by a red line. These labels are consistent across both the Macro_F1 Score and Micro_F1 Score graphs, indicating that the same two classifiers are being compared in both metrics."
