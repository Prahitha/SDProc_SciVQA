        "answer_pred": "The caption and visual loss were calculated using stochastic and aggregated loss methods.",
        "reasoning": "To determine how caption and visual loss are calculated, I will analyze the trends in the graphs. The visual loss graph shows that the red line (stochastic loss) starts high and decreases rapidly, while the blue line (aggregated loss) starts lower and decreases more gradually. The caption loss graph shows that the red line (stochastic loss) starts lower and remains relatively stable, while the blue line (aggregated loss) starts higher and fluctuates more. These trends suggest that the stochastic loss calculation is more aggressive in reducing loss, while the aggregated loss calculation is more conservative. The influence of these calculations on the results is evident in the differing rates of decrease and stability in the loss values over iterations."

The purple line represents DQN, and the orange line represents DQN+THER started with 2000 samples. I will then compare the final success rates of these two lines at the end of the environment steps. The graph shows that the orange line (DQN+THER started with 2000 samples) reaches a higher success rate than the purple line (DQN). This indicates that DQN+THER started with 2000 samples outperforms DQN in terms of final success rate."
