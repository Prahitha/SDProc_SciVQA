At epoch 10, I need to compare the y-values of the two lines. The blue line represents BLEU, and the red line represents SimiLe. Observing the graph, the red line is positioned above the blue line at epoch 10, indicating that SimiLe has a higher average expected BLEU cost than BLEU at this point."

        "reasoning": "1. The top plot shows the average expected BLEU cost over epochs for training with BLEU and SmiLe. The blue line represents the BLEU cost, and the red line represents the SmiLe cost.\n2. Initially, the BLEU cost (blue line) is higher than the SmiLe cost (red line). As the training progresses, the BLEU cost decreases, while the SmiLe cost increases.\n3. The bottom plot shows the average expected SmiLe cost over epochs for training with BLEU and SmiLe. The blue line represents the BLEU cost, and the red line represents the SmiLe cost.\n4. In this plot, the SmiLe cost (red line) is initially lower than the BLEU cost (blue line). As the training progresses, the SmiLe cost increases, while the BLEU cost decreases.\n5. Comparing the two plots, the BLEU cost is consistently higher than the SmiLe cost in the top plot, while in the bottom plot, the SmiLe cost is consistently higher than the BLEU cost.\n6. These observations indicate that the choice of cost metric affects the validation loss comparison, with BLEU favoring BLEU cost and SmiLe favoring SmiLe cost."

Observe the x-axis, which ranges from -4 to 4.\n3. Locate x = 2 on the x-axis of the 'tanh(x)' plot.\n4. Examine the corresponding y-value of the blue line at x = 2.\n5. Use the definition of the hyperbolic tangent function: tanh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x)).\n6. Substitute x = 2 into the formula: tanh(2) = (e^2 - e^(-2)) / (e^2 + e^(-2)).\n7. Calculate e^2 \u2248 7.389 and e^(-2) \u2248 0.1353.\n8. Substitute these values into the formula: tanh(2) \u2248 (7.389 - 0.1353) / (7.389 + 0.1353) \u2248 7.2547 / 7.5247 \u2248 0.97.\n9.

        "question": "What type of non-linearity is represented by the function tanh(x)?",
        "answer_pred": "Sigmoid",
        "reasoning": "The hyperbolic tangent function, denoted as tanh(x), is a well-known mathematical function. It maps any real-valued number to a value between -1 and 1. The graph of tanh(x) is S-shaped, starting from -1 at x = -\u221e, increasing to 1 at x = \u221e, and remaining between -1 and 1 for all other values of x. This S-shape indicates that tanh(x) is a smooth, continuous, and differentiable non-linearity. In the context of neural networks, tanh(x) is often used as an activation function because it maps the input to an output that is bounded between -1 and 1, which helps in preventing the vanishing or exploding gradient problem during backpropagation. Comparing this description with the standard types of non-linearities, tanh(x) matches the characteristics of a smooth non-linearity."

The tanh(x) function starts at -1, increases to 0 at x = 0, and reaches 1 as x approaches infinity. At x = 2, the curve is above the x-axis, indicating a positive value. The slope of the curve at x = 2 appears to be positive, suggesting that the function is increasing at this point."

The x-axis spans from -4 to 4 for all three graphs: step(x), tanh(x), and relu(x). The range is calculated by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values on the x-axis, which are 4 and -4, respectively. Therefore, the range is 4 - (-4) = 8."
