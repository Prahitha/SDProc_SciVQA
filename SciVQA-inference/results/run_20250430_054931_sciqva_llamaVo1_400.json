Focus on the Spearman correlation values on the y-axis and the number of important features (k) on the x-axis.\n3. Identify the lines representing different models: built-in, LIME, and SHAP using XGB, LSTM, and BERT.\n4. Observe how the correlation changes as k increases for each model.\n5.

The reported RL model consistently outperforms RL training and SL training, suggesting it uses a different or enhanced dataset. The black line for the reported RL model is higher than the red and blue lines, indicating better performance. This implies that the dataset used for the reported RL model is more effective, leading to improved results."
