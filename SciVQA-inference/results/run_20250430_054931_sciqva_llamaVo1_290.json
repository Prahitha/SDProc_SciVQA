Focus on the accuracy values for each method as the number of documents increases from 100 to 10,000.\n3. Note that the red line (CorrNet) consistently stays above the 70% accuracy mark across all document counts.\n4. The green line (Klementiev et al.) also remains above 70% accuracy but with some fluctuations.\n5. The blue line (MT) does not consistently stay above 70% accuracy, especially at lower document counts.\n6. Conclude that CorrNet is the method that consistently achieves an accuracy of over 70%."

The blue line represents MT, the green line represents Klementiev et al., and the red line represents CorrNet. As the number of documents increases, the red line (CorrNet) consistently shows higher accuracy compared to the other two models. This suggests that CorrNet was trained on a larger dataset, resulting in better performance."
