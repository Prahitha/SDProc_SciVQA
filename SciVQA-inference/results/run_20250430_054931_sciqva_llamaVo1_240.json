Compare the positions of these two lines across the range of average SNR (dB) values on the x-axis.\n4. Observe whether the line for Engine 2 (circles) is consistently higher than the line for Engine 4 (triangles) for all SNR values.\n5. Note if there are any instances where the lines intersect or overlap, which would indicate that Engine 2 is not always higher than Engine 4.\n\nBy following these steps, I will determine if the black line with circles is always higher than the black line with triangles."

        "reasoning": "To determine if the CER consistently increases with decreasing SNR, I will:\n\n1. Observe the trend of each engine's CER as the SNR decreases from clean to 0.0 dB.\n2. Note that all three engines (Engine 4, Engine 2, and the Kaldi chain) show an upward trend in CER as SNR decreases.\n3. Compare the CER values at different SNR points for each engine. For example, at 20.0 dB SNR, the CER for Engine 4 is lower than at 10.0 dB SNR. Similarly, Engine 2 and the Kaldi chain show an increase in CER as SNR decreases.\n4. Conclude that the CER consistently increases with decreasing SNR for all three engines."

        "answer_pred": "CER is calculated as the percentage of incorrectly recognized characters divided by the total number of characters, multiplied by 100. As the SNR increases, the CER decreases, indicating improved recognition accuracy.",
        "reasoning": "To solve the problem, I will analyze the graph to understand how the CER value is calculated based on the SNR. The graph shows three lines representing different models: Engine 4, Engine 2, and Kaldi chain with multi-condition noise. The x-axis represents the average SNR in dB, and the y-axis represents the CER percentage. As the SNR increases, the CER decreases for all models, indicating better performance at higher SNR levels. The lines show Engine 4 and Engine 2 performing similarly, while the Kaldi chain with multi-condition noise has a higher CER across all SNR levels."
