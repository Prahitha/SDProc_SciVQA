    "reasoning": "To determine the value of the blue line at x = 2 for the 'tanh(x)' plot, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the 'tanh(x)' plot, which is the second one from the left.\n2. Observe the x-axis, which ranges from -4 to 4.\n3. Locate x = 2 on the x-axis of the 'tanh(x)' plot.\n4. Examine the corresponding y-value of the blue line at x = 2.\n5. Use the definition of the hyperbolic tangent function: tanh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x)).\n6. Substitute x = 2 into the formula: tanh(2) = (e^2 - e^(-2)) / (e^2 + e^(-2)).\n7. Calculate e^2 \u2248 7.389 and e^(-2) \u2248 0.1353.\n8. Substitute these values into the formula: tanh(2) \u2248 (7.389 - 0.1353) / (7.389 + 0.1353) \u2248 7.2547 / 7.5247 \u2248 0.97.\n9.

    "question": "What type of non-linearity is represented by the function tanh(x)?",
    "answer_pred": "Sigmoid",
    "reasoning": "The hyperbolic tangent function, denoted as tanh(x), is a well-known mathematical function. It maps any real-valued number to a value between -1 and 1. The graph of tanh(x) is S-shaped, starting from -1 at x = -\u221e, increasing to 1 at x = \u221e, and remaining between -1 and 1 for all other values of x. This S-shape indicates that tanh(x) is a smooth, continuous, and differentiable non-linearity. In the context of neural networks, tanh(x) is often used as an activation function because it maps the input to an output that is bounded between -1 and 1, which helps in preventing the vanishing or exploding gradient problem during backpropagation. Comparing this description with the standard types of non-linearities, tanh(x) matches the characteristics of a smooth non-linearity."

The slope of the curve at x = 2 appears to be positive, suggesting that the function is increasing at this point."
