        "answer_pred": "Cohen's Kappa is calculated as the proportion of agreement between two raters minus the proportion of agreement expected by chance, divided by 1 minus the proportion of agreement expected by chance.",
        "reasoning": "Cohen's Kappa is a measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical data. It calculates the proportion of agreement beyond what would be expected by chance. The graph shows how Cohen's Kappa changes with the number of workers per \"expert\" for different MACE thresholds (0.85, 0.9, 0.95, and 1.0). As the number of workers increases, Cohen's Kappa generally increases for all thresholds, indicating better agreement. The threshold of 0.95 results in the highest Cohen's Kappa values, suggesting it is the optimal choice for balancing cost and reliability."
