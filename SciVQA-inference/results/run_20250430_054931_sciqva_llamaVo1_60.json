        "answer_pred": "Yes",
        "reasoning": "In the bottom subplot, the red line represents the Encoder Input, the blue dotted line represents the Encoder Output, and the green dashed line represents the Decoder Input. To determine if the red line is always lower than the green dashed line across all shown noise ratios, I will compare their positions at each noise ratio on the x-axis. Starting from 0% noise ratio, the red line is below the green dashed line. As the noise ratio increases, both lines decrease, but the red line consistently remains below the green dashed line at all noise ratios from 0% to 10%."

The x-axis represents the ratio of added noise, and the y-axis represents the Change of BLEU Score. The graph shows three lines: one for the encoder input, one for the encoder output, and one for the decoder input. I will look for the highest point on these lines and compare it to the value 0 on the y-axis."
