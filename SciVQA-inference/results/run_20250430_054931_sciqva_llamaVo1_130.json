Examine the trend of the line in the bottom rightmost plot.\n2. Observe the starting point and ending point of the line to see if there is an overall increase in accuracy.\n3. Check if there are any fluctuations or dips in the line that might indicate a lack of consistency in the increase.\n4. Compare the line to the other plots to ensure it is distinct and not overlapping with other lines.\n\nThe line in the bottom rightmost plot starts at a low accuracy and shows a gradual increase over time.
