        "answer_pred": "Yes",
        "reasoning": "To determine if the y-axis label is 'classification precision,' I will analyze the graph. The y-axis is labeled \"Classification accuracy,\" which typically refers to the proportion of correctly classified instances. The x-axis represents the length of the discriminated sub-sequences. The graph shows two lines: one for a discriminator with context and another for one without context. The shaded region likely represents a confidence interval or uncertainty around the data points. The question asks if the y-axis label is 'classification precision.' Since the y-axis is labeled \"Classification accuracy,\" it indicates the proportion of correct classifications, which aligns with the concept of precision in classification tasks."

        "reasoning": "To find the range of values for t, I will focus on the x-axis of the graph. The x-axis represents the length of the discriminated sub-sequences, denoted as t. Observing the graph, the x-axis starts at approximately 20 and ends at about 130. These are the minimum and maximum values on the x-axis, indicating the range of t."

The blue line represents the graph size, and I need to find its value when the number of keywords is 500. I will locate the point on the blue line corresponding to 500 keywords on the x-axis and read the value on the y-axis. This will give me the size of the graph when the number of keywords is 500."
