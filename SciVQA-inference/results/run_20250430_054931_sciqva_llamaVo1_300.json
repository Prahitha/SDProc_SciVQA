The first subplot is labeled \"permutations,\" the second is labeled \"new edge,\" and the third is labeled \"new edge+node.\" These labels indicate the type of environment each subplot represents. The lines within each subplot are color-coded to represent different transfer types, such as \"conv,\" \"film,\" \"film^2,\" \"conv transfer,\" \"film transfer,\" and \"film^2 transfer.\" The bold, dark lines represent the average win rates, while the lighter lines represent individual runs. The x-axis shows the number of frames, and the y-axis shows the win rate."

Identify the different methods used to calculate the win rate: \"conv,\" \"film,\" \"film^2,\" \"conv transfer,\" \"film transfer,\" and \"film^2 transfer.\"\n2. Observe the learning curves for each method across the three environments: \"permutations,\" \"new edge,\" and \"new edge+node.\"\n3. Note that the win rate is plotted on the y-axis against the number of frames on the x-axis.\n4. Recognize that the bold, dark lines represent the average win rate for each method.\n5. Compare the y-axis and x-axis scales across the plots, noting any differences.\n6. Identify which lines correspond to which entities and distinguish them from shaded regions, which represent confidence intervals.\n7. Analyze overlapping lines or narrow peaks to understand how the win rate calculation impacts the results."

Calculate the improvement in accuracy by subtracting the pretraining accuracy from the post-fine-tuning accuracy: 0.81 - 0.79 = 0.02."
