Follow the blue line as the edit distance increases from 0 to 30.\n4. Note the trend of the blue line in terms of accuracy on the y-axis.\n5. Determine whether the accuracy of the blue line increases, decreases, or remains constant as the edit distance increases.\n\nUpon examining the graph, the blue line starts at a high accuracy point at an edit distance of 0 and gradually decreases as the edit distance increases to 30. This indicates that the accuracy of the Swapping strategy decreases as the edit distance increases."

Starting with Insertion (black), Swapping (blue), Substitution (cyan), and Deletion (magenta), I will observe how the accuracy changes as the edit distance increases from 0 to 30. For each function, I will check if the accuracy consistently decreases or if there are any points where the accuracy increases or remains stable. By comparing these trends across all functions, I can conclude whether all functions show a decrease in accuracy with increasing edit distance."

The graph shows four lines representing different token transformer strategies: Insertion, Swapping, Substitution, and Deletion. Each line shows how the accuracy of the BILSTM model changes as the edit distance increases from 0 to 30.

Examine the graph's legend to identify which line corresponds to each type of attack: Insertion, Swapping, Substitution, and Deletion.\n2. Observe how the accuracy decreases as the edit distance increases for each type of attack.\n3. Note that the Insertion attack starts with the highest accuracy at 0 edit distance, followed by Swapping, Substitution, and Deletion.\n4. Analyze how each type of attack affects the model's accuracy at different edit distances.\n5. Recognize that as the edit distance increases, the accuracy of all attacks decreases, with Insertion maintaining the highest accuracy.\n6.
