The logistic function is characterized by an S-shaped curve, which starts slowly, increases rapidly in the middle, and then levels off at the ends. The equation \\( h(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-x)} \\) ensures that the output ranges between 0 and 1. Observing the red line, it exhibits this characteristic S-shape, confirming that it represents the logistic function."

The blue dotted line appears to be a straight line with a positive slope, indicating a linear function. The red solid line is a smooth, S-shaped curve, which is typical of a logistic function. The logistic function is defined by the equation \\( h(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-x)} \\), which maps input values to output values between 0 and 1. This matches the behavior of the red curve in the graph."

        "reasoning": "To determine if the linear function has a constant increase, I will examine the slope of the linear function. The linear function is represented by a straight line with a positive slope, indicating a constant rate of change. In contrast, the logistic function has a non-linear, S-shaped curve, indicating a non-constant rate of change. Since the linear function maintains a consistent slope, it exhibits a constant increase."
