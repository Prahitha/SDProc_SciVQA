The \"Better\" and \"Worse\" lines increase as the number of tokens increases, suggesting an improvement with more tokens. The \"No Change\" line decreases, indicating fewer instances of no change with more tokens. The \"No. of Sentences\" line shows a decrease, suggesting fewer sentences with more tokens.

Check if the green dotted line remains above the orange dashed line throughout the entire range or if there are any instances where they intersect or the orange dashed line surpasses the green dotted line.\n4.

Observe the starting and ending points of this line on the graph.\n3. Check if the line generally trends upwards from left to right, indicating an increase in BLEU score with cumulative cost.\n4. Note if there are any significant dips or plateaus in the line that might suggest a lack of consistent increase.\n\nBy following these steps, I can assess whether the BLEU score for eps0.9 generally increases with cumulative cost."
