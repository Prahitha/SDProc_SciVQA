        "question": "At what number of sentences does the Unigram model reach 1.0 accuracy?",
        "answer_pred": "D",
        "reasoning": "To determine at what number of sentences the Unigram model reaches 1.0 accuracy, I will focus on the top graph (a) where the Unigram model is represented by blue squares. I will look for the point where the blue squares reach the top of the y-axis, indicating an accuracy of 1.0. The x-axis represents the number of sentences, so I will identify the corresponding value on this axis."

        "reasoning": "To solve the problem, I will focus on subplot (d), which displays the gradient norms for the top BERT layer. The x-axis represents training steps, and the y-axis shows the gradient norm values. I will locate the blue line, which corresponds to the ANCE (First) method, at the 25k training step on the x-axis. I will then read the approximate value of the gradient norm from the y-axis at this point."

I will look for the highest point reached by the training loss line within this range. The plot shows a decreasing trend in training loss over the training steps, and the maximum value appears to be slightly above 0.5. This aligns with the standard answer provided."

Identify the blue line, which represents ANCE (First).\n3. Examine the values of the blue line at training steps 5k and 20k.\n4.

The x-axis represents the number of training steps, and the y-axis represents the gradient norm. I will observe the trend of the blue line, which represents the gradient norm for the top BERT layers. As the number of training steps increases, I will look for a decrease in the gradient norm values on the y-axis."

Observe the Grad Norm plots (b, c, d) to see the behavior of gradient norms across different layers.\n3. Identify the lines representing different models: ANCE(First), BM25->NCE Neg, BM25->Rand, and BM25->BM25+Rand.\n4. Focus on the Grad Norm (Bottom) plot (b), where the lines for BM25->NCE Neg, BM25->Rand, and BM25->BM25+Rand remain relatively flat, indicating minimal change throughout training.\n5.

Compare the peak values across all plots to determine which one has the highest peak.\n4. Note that plot (a) represents training loss, while plots (b), (c), and (d) represent gradient norms.\n5.

The BM25 warm-up is represented by specific colored lines in these subplots. I will compare these lines with the shaded regions, which represent confidence intervals, to understand how the BM25 warm-up differs from other warm-up techniques. By examining the gradient norms, I will identify any differences in behavior, such as overlapping lines or narrow peaks, that indicate the unique characteristics of the BM25 warm-up."
