Observe the trend of both lines over the x-axis (Epoch) from 0 to 50.\n4. Compare the final values of both lines at Epoch 50.\n5. The blue line \"DetachNorm\" ends at approximately 4.0, while the red line \"LayerNorm-simple\" ends at approximately 4.2.\n6. Since 4.0 is less than 4.2, the blue line reaches a lower value than the red line."

        "answer_pred": "Yes",
        "reasoning": "To solve the problem, I will first identify the lines in the graph that correspond to 'DetachNorm' and 'LayerNorm-simple'. The graph has two sets of lines, one for 'De-En' and one for 'En-Vi'. Each set includes two lines, one for 'DetachNorm' and one for 'LayerNorm-simple'. I will verify that these lines are present in the graph by checking the labels next to the lines. The presence of these lines confirms that the values for 'DetachNorm' and 'LayerNorm-simple' are indeed presented in the figure."

Examine the graph's legend, which indicates that 'DetachNorm' is represented by a blue line.\n2. Look at the leftmost graph and identify the line that is colored blue.\n3. Confirm that this blue line corresponds to 'DetachNorm' based on the legend."

The left graph is labeled \"De-En,\" indicating it represents the English-to-German translation task. The right graph is labeled \"En-Vi,\" indicating it represents the English-to-Vietnamese translation task. Each graph has two lines: one for \"DetachNorm\" and one for \"LayerNorm-simple.\" These labels help identify the normalization techniques used for each language pair."

Note that the DetachNorm model is represented by a blue line, while the LayerNorm-simple model is represented by a red line.\n3. Observe that the DetachNorm model consistently shows lower validation loss than the LayerNorm-simple model across both datasets.\n4. Compare the y-axis and x-axis scales between the two plots to ensure accurate interpretation.\n5. Focus on how the DetachNorm model maintains a lower validation loss throughout the epochs, indicating better performance.\n6. Conclude that the implementation of DetachNorm leads to improved results compared to LayerNorm-simple."

Locate the black dots representing the data points on the Frappat plot.\n4. Identify the black dot with the highest value on the y-axis, indicating the highest score.\n5.

Since the x-axis range is consistent across all subplots, the range of values on the x-axis is from 0 to 25.\n4. Calculate the range by subtracting the minimum value (0) from the maximum value (25).\n5. The range is therefore 25 - 0 = 25."
