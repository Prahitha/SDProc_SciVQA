        "reasoning": "The graph shows the relationship between the number of top examples with the highest MCD and the accuracy of the teacher's predictions. As the number of examples increases from 0 to 2000, the accuracy score decreases from approximately 1.00 to around 0.75. This suggests that using more examples with the highest MCD results in lower accuracy. The graph does not show any overlapping lines or narrow peaks, and there are no shaded regions representing confidence intervals."
