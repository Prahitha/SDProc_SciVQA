        "answer_pred": "Yes",
        "reasoning": "To solve the problem, I will first identify the red and orange lines in the left plot. The red line represents GLU, and the orange line represents GTU. I will then compare their test perplexity values over the epochs. By observing the graph, I can see that the red line (GLU) consistently stays below the orange line (GTU) throughout the epochs. This indicates that GLU achieves a lower test perplexity than GTU."

In the left graph, Tahn is represented by a purple line, and Relu is represented by a blue line. Both lines are clearly visible, indicating that Tahn and Relu are presented in the figure."

The legend indicates that Tanh is represented by the purple line, and GLU is represented by the red line.

Focus on the right side of the graph, where the x-axis represents hours and the y-axis represents test perplexity.\n2. Identify the lines corresponding to each activation mechanism: ReLU, GTU, and GLU.\n3. Observe the y-values of these lines at the 100-hour mark.\n4. Compare these y-values to identify which line reaches the highest point on the y-axis at 100 hours.\n5. Note that the line for ReLU reaches the highest point compared to GTU and GLU at 100 hours."

Observe the left graph, which shows test perplexity over epochs on the WikiText-103 dataset.\n3. Note that the GLU line converges faster and to a lower perplexity compared to other mechanisms.\n4. Examine the right graph, which shows test perplexity over hours on the Google Billion Word dataset.\n5. Again, observe that the GLU line converges faster and to a lower perplexity compared to other mechanisms.\n6. Conclude that GLU consistently outperforms other activation mechanisms in terms of convergence speed and perplexity."

Locate the x-axis value of 1.7, which corresponds to the LM score.\n3. Identify the position of the blue dot at this LM score on the y-axis, which represents the decoding time in seconds.\n4.

In the left plot, there are three lines representing different methods: Temperature, Generator Rejection, and Beam Search. Similarly, in the right plot, there are also three lines representing the same methods. Therefore, the total number of methods presented in the plots is three."

To determine if the green line is consistently lower than the red line, I will compare their positions across the range of LM scores on the x-axis. The green line starts lower than the red line and remains below it throughout the range of LM scores from 1.5 to 3.5. Therefore, the green line is consistently lower than the red line."

Look at the left graph to find the red line, as indicated by the legend.\n3. Confirm that the red line consistently represents 'Temperature' across both graphs.\n4.
