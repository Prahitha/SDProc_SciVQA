        "answer_pred": "B",
        "reasoning": "To find the range of the w(t) values, I will focus on the left graph where w(t) is plotted. The y-axis for w(t) ranges from 0 to 10. The function w(t) starts at 0, increases to a maximum value of 10, and then decreases back to 0. Therefore, the range of w(t) values is from 0 to 10."

        "answer_pred": "w(t) = 10sin(\u03c0t/2000)",
        "reasoning": "The graph on the left shows the scheduling function w(t), which starts at 0, increases to a maximum value of 10, and then decreases back to 0. The graph on the right shows the corresponding learning rate, which starts at 0, increases to a maximum value, and then decreases back to 0. The scheduling function w(t) affects the learning rate by multiplying it. As w(t) increases, the learning rate also increases, and as w(t) decreases, the learning rate decreases."

Then, I will trace vertically upwards to find the corresponding value on the y-axis, which represents the ROUGE-1 score. According to the graph, at a window size of 11, the ROUGE-1 score for the blue line is approximately 32.5."

        "reasoning": "To determine if the ROUGE-1 score increases monotonically as the window size increases, I will analyze the trend of the data points on the graph. Starting with a window size of 5, the ROUGE-1 score is approximately 31.5. As the window size increases to 11, the score rises to about 32.5. Continuing to a window size of 13, the score further increases to around 33.0. However, when the window size reaches 15, the score drops back to approximately 31.5. This indicates that the ROUGE-1 score does not consistently increase with each increment in window size."

The x-axis represents window sizes from 5 to 15, and the y-axis represents ROUGE-1 values from 31.0 to 33.5. I will identify the data point with the highest y-value, which corresponds to the highest ROUGE-1 value. The graph shows that the highest ROUGE-1 value occurs at a window size of 13, where the ROUGE-1 value is approximately 33.0."
