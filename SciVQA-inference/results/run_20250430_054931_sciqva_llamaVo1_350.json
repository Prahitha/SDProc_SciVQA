The lines are labeled as Train-0.7, Train-0.3, Train-0.1, Valid-0.7, Valid-0.3, and Valid-0.1, indicating different dropout rates during training and validation. The upward trend in F1-Multi scores for Train-0.7, Train-0.3, and Train-0.1 suggests that higher dropout rates during training lead to better performance. The stable scores for Valid-0.7, Valid-0.3, and Valid-0.1 indicate that these dropout rates during validation do not significantly impact performance."
