        "answer_pred": "The average time spent in wrap-up per meeting is 4.5 minutes.",
        "reasoning": "To determine the average time spent in wrap-up per meeting, I will focus on the bottom graph. The x-axis represents the time spent until all decisions are made, while the y-axis represents the time spent until meeting dismissals. The red line indicates the total meeting time, and the blue line indicates the time decisions are made. The wrap-up time is the difference between the total meeting time and the time decisions are made. The graph shows that as the time spent until all decisions are made increases, the time spent until meeting dismissals also increases. The wrap-up time is represented by the area between the red and blue lines."

        "reasoning": "To determine if the blue line (CCL) is always decreasing, I will examine its trend from N=0 to N=8,000. Starting at N=0, the blue line is above the baseline line, indicating a higher GDL. As N increases, the blue line initially decreases, but around N=2,000, it starts to increase and remains above the baseline until N=4,000. From N=4,000 to N=8,000, the blue line decreases again. Therefore, the blue line is not always decreasing; it increases between N=2,000 and N=4,000."

As N increases from 0 to 8000, the orange line shows a downward trend, indicating that the average GDL decreases. This suggests that the baseline grammar does not increase with increasing N."

The range is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value: \\( 1.0 - 0.5 = 0.5 \\). Therefore, the range of values on the y-axis is 0.5."
