Locate the point on the graph where the average emotional response is 0.\n2. Observe the y-axis values for both the line representing websites (squares) and the line representing users (circles) at this point.\n3. Compare these y-axis values to see if they are the same, indicating that both websites and users start with the same number of threads when the emotional response is 0."
