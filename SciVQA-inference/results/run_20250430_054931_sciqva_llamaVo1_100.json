        "answer_pred": "4",
        "reasoning": "To solve the problem, I will first identify the number of distinct lines in each plot, as each line represents a different ML algorithm or feature selection method. I will then count these lines across all the plots to determine the total number of algorithms being compared. I will ensure that I do not count any overlapping lines or shaded regions, as these represent confidence intervals rather than separate algorithms. By following these steps, I can accurately determine the total number of ML algorithms compared in Figure 24."

Check if the Random Forest line is consistently above the Adaptive Boosting line for all values of the number of selected features.\n4.
