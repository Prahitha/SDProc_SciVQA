        "answer_pred": "D",
        "reasoning": "To identify the two functions in the first subplot (A), I will examine the labels and characteristics of the lines. The dashed line is labeled as \"exponential,\" and the solid line is labeled as \"power-law.\" These labels directly indicate the functions represented by the lines. The exponential function is typically represented by a dashed line, while the power-law function is represented by a solid line."

        "answer_pred": "[-0.02, 0.02]",
        "reasoning": "To determine the value of the fitting errors, I will focus on the y-axis of the graph. The y-axis ranges from -0.02 to 0.02, indicating that the fitting errors are within this range. By examining the graph, I can see that the lines representing the fitting errors for each function do not exceed this range. Therefore, the value of the fitting errors for the ten functions used in Fig. 4 is within the range of -0.02 to 0.02."

Observe the graph and locate the blue line.\n3. Check if the blue line aligns with the T-Base label in the legend.\n4. Confirm that the blue line consistently represents T-Base across different amounts of training data.\n\nBy following these steps, I can accurately determine if the blue line represents the T-Base results."

The x-axis represents the amount of training data, and the y-axis represents the MCD on the evaluation set. As the amount of training data increases from 0.5 to 25, all lines show a downward trend, indicating a decrease in MCD. The lines for T-Base, T-Enc, T-Dec, and T-Enc-Dec all decrease, suggesting that more training data leads to lower MCD values for all methods."

The y-axis is labeled as \"MCD on evaluation set,\" indicating that it measures the Mean Cosine Distance (MCD) on the evaluation set. The values on the y-axis range from 0.5 to 30, showing the variation in MCD as the amount of training data increases from 0.5 to 25 shards."

The x-axis ranges from 0.5 to 25, suggesting that the training data increases as the value on the x-axis increases. The y-axis represents the MCD on the evaluation set, showing a decrease in MCD values as the amount of training data increases. This indicates that more training data leads to better model performance. The four lines represent different models: T-Base, T-Enc, T-Dec, and T-Enc-Dec. The graph shows that all models benefit from increased training data, with T-Base and T-Enc-Dec performing slightly better than T-Enc and T-Dec."
