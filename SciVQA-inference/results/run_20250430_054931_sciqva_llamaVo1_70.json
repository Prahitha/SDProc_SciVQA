Observe the x-axis, which represents the number of parallel sentences, and the y-axis, which represents accuracy.\n3. Compare the accuracy curves for each model across the four language pairs: es \u2192 en, en \u2192 es, de \u2192 en, and de \u2192 es.\n4. Note that the SDAE (transfer) model consistently shows the highest accuracy across all language pairs.\n5.
