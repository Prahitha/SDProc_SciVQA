Among these, score 1 has the highest percentage at 17.6%, followed by score 2 at 13.6%, score 3 at 9.5%, score 4 at 4.1%, and score 5 at 1.2%. Therefore, score 1 was given most often by annotators."

Identify the percentage of non-humorous tweets, which is 46.1% combined for scores 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n3. Calculate the mean score for the humorous tweets by multiplying each score by its respective percentage and summing these products:\n   - Score 1: 1 \u00d7 0.176 = 0.176\n   - Score 2: 2 \u00d7 0.136 = 0.272\n   - Score 3: 3 \u00d7 0.095 = 0.285\n   - Score 4: 4 \u00d7 0.041 = 0.164\n   - Score 5: 5 \u00d7 0.539 = 2.695\n4. Sum these products: 0.176 + 0.272 + 0.285 + 0.164 + 2.695 = 3.392\n5. Divide the sum by the total percentage of humorous tweets (53.9%) to find the mean score: 3.392 \u00f7 0.539 = 6.3."
