        "answer_pred": "No",
        "reasoning": "1. Examine the left graph (a) for IAPR-TC12. The horizontal lines represent the JOINT model, while the increasing lines represent the ORACLE model.\n2. Note that the BLEU scores for the JOINT model are consistently higher than those for the ORACLE model as the number of training pairs increases.\n3. Examine the right graph (b) for Multi30K. Again, the horizontal lines represent the JOINT model, while the increasing lines represent the ORACLE model.\n4. Observe that the BLEU scores for the JOINT model are consistently higher than those for the ORACLE model as the number of training pairs increases.\n5.

        "answer_pred": "A, B, C, D",
        "reasoning": "In the right graph (b), the JOINT model is represented by horizontal lines. These lines indicate that the BLEU score remains constant regardless of the number of training pairs. This suggests that the JOINT model does not improve with more training data, maintaining a consistent performance level."

Observe the trend of this line as the FGET training size increases on the x-axis.\n3. Check if the line shows an upward trend, indicating improved performance.\n4. Compare the performance of 'bpe1e3' across different morphological types (T, TR, EN, HE, ZH) to see if the improvement is consistent.\n5. Note any differences in the y-axis and x-axis scales across the plots to ensure accurate comparison.\n\nBy following these steps, I can assess whether 'bpe1e3' consistently shows improved performance as the FGET training size increases."

Note that the y-axis represents test accuracy scores, and the x-axis represents the WE training size.\n4. Compare the positions of the lines to determine which one is consistently at the lowest point on the y-axis across different WE training sizes.\n5. Recognize that the line corresponding to the FGET training size of 20000 is consistently positioned at the lowest point on the y-axis compared to other lines.\n6.
