        "reasoning": "To determine how the F1-score is calculated and how it influences the results, I will examine the relationship between the number of authors and the F1-scores for each model in both the Emails and Blogs datasets. The F1-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, reflecting a model's ability to correctly identify both true positives and true negatives. In the graphs, the F1-scores are plotted against the number of authors, showing how performance changes as more authors are considered. The lines represent different models: CNN-char, SCAP, CNN-word-char, and CNN-word-char. The shaded regions indicate confidence intervals. In the Emails dataset, CNN-char and SCAP have higher F1-scores, while in the Blogs dataset, CNN-word-char and CNN-word-char have higher F1-scores. As the number of authors increases, the F1-scores generally decrease, except for CNN-word-char in the Blogs dataset, which shows a peak at 200 authors."
