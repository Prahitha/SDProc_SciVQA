Note that 'Broadcast speech' is represented by a red line, while 'Conversational Speech' is represented by a red dashed line.\n4. Compare the positions of the two lines year by year to see if 'Broadcast speech' consistently remains above 'Conversational Speech'.\n5. Check for any years where the lines intersect or where 'Conversational Speech' surpasses 'Broadcast speech'.\n6.

Observe the WER value at this point, which is marked at 15%.\n4. Identify the benchmark test associated with this WER value.\n5. Verify that the WER of 15% corresponds to the correct benchmark test by cross-referencing with other datasets and their respective WER values.\n\nBy following these steps, I can accurately determine the benchmark test that resulted in a WER of 15% for the News English unlimitted dataset in May 2009."

Observe the starting point of the blue line at the shortest sentence length (1-5 words) and note its position on the y-axis.\n2. Follow the blue line as it progresses to longer sentence lengths, noting any changes in direction.\n3. Examine the endpoint of the blue line at the longest sentence length (over 50 words) and note its position on the y-axis.\n4. Assess whether the line generally slopes downward from the beginning to the end, indicating a decrease in relative improvement as sentence length increases."
