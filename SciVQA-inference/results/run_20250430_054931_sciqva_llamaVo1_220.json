The \"Avg\" line is shown in blue. I will verify that this line is distinct from the other lines, which represent the best performing system (red) and the MTI (green). By observing the graph, the \"Avg\" line consistently stays below the red line and above the green line, indicating that it represents the average micro f-measure."
