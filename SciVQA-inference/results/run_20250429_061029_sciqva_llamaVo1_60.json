Confirm that the red line corresponds to a step size of 0.01, the green line corresponds to a step size of 0.005, and the blue line corresponds to a step size of 0.0005.\n5.

The y-axis represents the value of L(u(k)), and the x-axis represents the number of iterations. The graph shows a downward trend for all step sizes, indicating a decrease in L(u(k)) as the number of iterations increases. The line corresponding to the step size 0.01 is red, 0.005 is green, and 0.0005 is blue. The graph suggests that a smaller step size (0.0005) results in a lower value of L(u(k)) compared to larger step sizes (0.01 and 0.005)."

Note that the 4gram (SRI) and 4gram (NNLM) lines are closer together, indicating similar performance.\n4. In the bottom plot (b), focus on the mean accuracies for 4gram (SRI) and 4gram (NNLM).\n5. Observe that the 4gram (SRI) and 4gram (NNLM) lines in plot (b) are closer together compared to the individual accuracies in plot (a).\n6. The shaded regions in both plots represent confidence intervals, indicating variability in the data.\n7. Compare the y-axis and x-axis scales between the two plots to ensure accurate interpretation."
