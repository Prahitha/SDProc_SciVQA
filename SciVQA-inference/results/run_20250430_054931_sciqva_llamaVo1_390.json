Check the value for the >50 sentence length range, which is the last data point on the graph.\n5. Compare this value with all previous data points to see if it is the highest.\n\nThe graph shows that the relative improvement decreases as sentence length increases.

        "reasoning": "To find the sentence length range with the highest relative improvement, I will look for the peak of the blue line on the graph. The x-axis represents different sentence length ranges, and the y-axis shows the relative improvement. By identifying where the blue line reaches its highest point on the y-axis, I can determine the corresponding sentence length range on the x-axis."

        "reasoning": "To determine the language pairs used in the experiment, I will focus on the x-axis, which represents sentence length, and the y-axis, which represents relative improvement. The graph shows a trend where the relative improvement is highest for shorter sentence lengths (1-5) and decreases as sentence length increases. This indicates that the experiment likely involves language pairs where NMT (Neural Machine Translation) outperforms PBMT (Phrase-Based Machine Translation) for shorter sentences."

Compare these observations across all subplots to determine if this pattern is consistent or if there are exceptions.\n\nBy following these steps, I can determine if the Spearman correlation always increases as the number of important features increases."
