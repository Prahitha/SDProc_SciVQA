Look at graph (b) to determine which method has the lowest decoding time, indicating efficiency.\n3. Compare the results from both graphs to find the method that provides the best trade-off between quality/diversity and decoding time.\n\nIn graph (a), the Beam Search method has the highest LM score, indicating better quality and diversity. In graph (b), Beam Search also has the lowest decoding time, indicating efficiency. Therefore, Beam Search provides the best trade-off between quality/diversity and decoding time."

I will then analyze the trends in both graphs. In the left graph, I will observe how diversity and quality change with LM score for each method. In the right graph, I will examine how decoding time changes with LM score for each method. By comparing these trends, I will determine the specific dataset used and how it affects the results."

I will observe the trend of this line across the x-axis, which ranges from 0 to 40 epochs. The red line starts at a higher value on the y-axis, around 6.5, and consistently decreases as the number of epochs increases. By the end of the 40 epochs, the red line reaches a value close to 0.5. This consistent downward trend indicates that the train loss for the wiki dataset decreases over time."
