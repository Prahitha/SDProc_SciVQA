The red line is the logistic function, and the blue dashed line is the linear function. The X-axis represents the input variable x, and the Y-axis represents the output variable h(x). The scale ranges from 0 to 1 on the Y-axis. The logistic function curve is concave, with an inflection point at x = 0.",
