('There are four social media platforms preferred by more than 70% of teens.', 'First, I will identify each platform and its corresponding percentage of preference among teens. I will then determine which platforms have a preference rate of more than 70%. Instagram (85%), TikTok (88%), Snapchat (75%), and YouTube (92%) all meet this criterion. I will count these platforms to find the total number that are preferred by more than 70% of teens.')
