The image contains two graphs The top graph shows the number of documents with an "attacking" country per 3-month period for the USA from 1990 to 2005 The bottom graph displays the same data for Serbia/Yugoslavia and NATO from 1995 to 2000 The dark line represents the posterior mean, and the shaded region indicates the 95% posterior credible interval

To determine if the number of documents with an "attacking" country per 3-month period for the USA is consistently higher than that of Serbia/Yugoslavia, I will:

1 Examine the graph for the USA to identify the trend in the number of documents over time
2 Compare this trend with the graph for Serbia/Yugoslavia
3 Assess whether the USA consistently has a higher number of documents than Serbia/Yugoslavia across the timeline
Yes
